                <p class="whatisStem" id="floatpad">
                    Stem Cells contain anti-inflammatory chemicals (interleukines) that recruit healing, increase
                    vascularity, and decrease pain

                    Mesenchymal stem cells are primitive cells with the ability to <br>
                    1. Reduce inflammation<br>
                    2. Fight apoptosis (cell death)<br>
                    3. Differential into multiple tissues: bone, muscle, cartilage, fat<br>
                    4. Self replicate<br>
                    <br>
                    They have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-apoptotic, and pro-angiogenic (promote the formation of blood vessels and blood flow properties)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The complication rate for bone marrow concentrate as stem cells is less then 1%.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Recent study by hernigou in the Journalof International Orthopaedics revealed that the addition of stem cells in rotator cuff repair improved healing and prevented further tears.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 patients received mesenchymal stem cells agter a rotator cuff repair and this was matched against 45 patients with the same surgery but no stem cells. These patients were follewd at 1 year, 2 years, and 10 years.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They found that the 45 patients with the stem cells, 100% healed at 6 months, 87% healed at 10 years.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was compared to the 45 patients without the stem cells where only 67% healed at 6 months and 44% healed at 10 years.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence that the rotator cuff heals quicker and better when stem cells are added.

                    Recent publication in Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2015, title Regeneration of Full-Thickness Rotator Cuff Tendon Tear After Ultrasound Guided Injection with Umbilical Cord Blood, Dried Mesechymal Stem Cells in a Rabbit Model. 
                    <br>
                    This study revealed that stem cells induced regeneration of rotator cuff tendon.

                    A 2015 publication in the Journal of Pain research by Centeno CJ. This study revealed that the 115 shoulders treated with a bone marrow concentrated stem cell injection resulted in a 44% reduction in pain up to 2 years after the injection.

                    A study in The American Journal of Sports Medicine 2015 found that injection versus implantation of mesechymal stem cells for knee arthritis resulted in significantly improved knee pain and function scores.

                    A study in BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2015, author Centeno CJ, article titled A Dose Response Analysis of Specific Bone Marrow Concentrate Treatment Protocol for Knee Osteoarthritis.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	373 patients received 424 injections for arthritic knee joints. They were followed with 	questionaires at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter. Results were that 	patients had improved function and reduced pain when treated with bone marrow 	concentrate injections. The study found that the patients with the higher concentration 	of stem cells in the injections had better outcomes.

                    A 2014 publication, The European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, title Clinical Outcome of Autologous Bone Marrow Aspirates Concentrate Injection in Degenerative Arthritis of the Knee results in 41 patients, average 61 years of age, with a single injections saw a 50% improvement at 1 year.

                    A study by Goby in Cartilage 2015, found that patients who received a stem cell treatment for cartilage injury in the patellofemoral joint had complete filling of the defect in 81% of the patients. Cartilage analysis revealed normal appearing cartilage. The conclusion was that this was an effective technique at minimum 3 year follow up.

                    <br>
                    A study in Cartilage 2015. 18 patients followed at 3 years revealed that 82% of the patients had complete filling of their cartilage defects with the bone marrow concentrate.

                    Recent medial literature supports the use of bone marrow aspirate stem cells for promotion of healing after orthopedic surgery. Examples would include rotator cuff repair, ACL reconstruction, Achilles' repair, or any other soft tissue type of surgery or reconstruction. Studies also support the use of bone marrow aspirates concentrated stem cells for treatment of degenerative joints and degenerative conditions. Examples would include osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and shoulder, as well as degenerative disc disease of the spine.
