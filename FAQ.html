                <p class="FAQ">
                    There is great excitement and interest about the use of stem cells to improve or reverse chronic
                    disease. Stem cells contain anti-inflammatory chemicals that recruit healing, increase vascularity
                    and decrease pain. These cells can fight cellular apoptosis (cellular death) and differentiate into
                    multiple tissues, including: bone, muscle, cartilage and fat. They are capable of self-replication.

                    The science of stem cell use for regenerative medicine is young and still much is unknown about
                    long term outcomes and effective applications. Due to the infancy of regenerative medicine,
                    many providers are willing to take advantage of the potential of stem cell use and consumer
                    enthusiasm as "the fountain of youth". Providers are willing to push the indications for the use of
                    stem cells, consumers are ready to pay for it, but given the immaturity of the clinical science, we
                    would like to dispel some confusion and educate our patients.

                    <br>
                    1- Stem cells from donor patients can be injected into recipient patients
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth: Stem cells do not come in a bottle
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA has only permitted the use of live stem cells taken from a single patient's own
                    bone marrow, to be reinjected into the same patient on the same day, with minimal
                    manipulation. These cells cannot by frozen, stored, altered or donated. This regulation
                    even precludes the use of one's own fat tissue being used.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many providers are advertising "live stem cells from amniotic products". This is
                    misinformation. These formulations contain some of the active growth factors, collagen,
                    and elements that cause inflammation and promote healing. These products are
                    dehydrated and processed. They come in a bottle with a shelf life of five years. There are
                    NO LIVE CELLS in these products.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you got an injection out of a bottle, make no mistake, there were no stem cells involved

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth: There is no definitive evidence that a stem cell injection will prevent progression
                    of arthritis, change the natural history of a degenerative joint or preclude the need for
                    joint replacement.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and after x-rays showing an improvement in the joint space are a gimmick.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some evidence that stem cells improve the health of the joint, cause hypertrophy
                    (improved health) of the chondrocytes (cartilage cells), improve the viscoelasticity of the
                    joint fluid (like a young healthy knee), provide an anti- inflammatory effect,
                    fight apoptosis (cell death), provide an anti-microbial effect and improve blood flow.

                <p class="FAQ">
                    1- Stem cells used with surgery promotes healing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A European surgeon named Hernigou showed that the application of stem cells
                    with rotator cuff repair surgery improved healing from 67% to 100% at 6 months, and
                    from 44% to 87% healed at 10 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When injected into an injured rotator cuff tendon (partial tear), the stem cells induced
                    regeneration of the tendon defect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other studies showed improved healing with application of bone marrow concentrate into
                    ACL, achilles repair or other soft tissue reconstruction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2- Stem cell injections into degenerative joints reduce pain and improve function
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115 degenerative shoulders injected with bone marrow concentrated stem cells resulted in
                    a 44% reduction in pain for up to two years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar injections into 424 arthritic knees resulted in improved knee pain and function
                    scores
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3- Stem cell treatment for cartilage injury healed the defect
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who had a bone marrow concentrate placed into a cartilage defect, had complete
                    filling of the defect in 81% of patients at minimum follow up of 3 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This data demonstrates promise for the responsible use of bone marrow concentrate stem
                    cells. We are also aware of the unethical and unsupported use of these and related
                    products. It is important for the consumer to be wary of providers who are looking for an
                    opportunity to take advantage of this enthusiasm and provide misinformation.
